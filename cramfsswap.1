.SH NAME
cramfsswap \- swap endianness of a cram filesystem (cramfs)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cramfsswap <infile> <outfile>
.SH DESCRIPTION
cramfs is a highly compressed and size optimized linux filesystem which is
mainly used for embedded applications. the problem with cramfs is that it
is endianness sensitive, meaning you can't mount a cramfs for a big endian
target on a little endian machine and vice versa. this is often especially 
a problem in the development phase.

cramfsswap solves that problem by allowing you to swap to endianness of a
cramfs filesystem.
